# Overview
In this project I wanted to learn more about dealing with data using pandas. I wanted to learn how to read and access data in a csv file, and perform simple retrievals and evaluations.

The data set I used came from https://www.kaggle.com/andrewmvd/board-games and it is based on data from Board Game Geek. It is all the stats and details for different board games. 

This program is for people looking for a new board game to play, and it allows them to enter in what they are looking for in a board game, then returns games that would be a good fit. I allow the user to set a time limit, player count, complexity level, lowest player age, and minimum user rating. The program then filters throguh the database, only keeping the games that fit their requirements. It then prints the top five suggestions for them.

{Provide a link to your YouTube demonstration.  It should be a 4-5 minute demo of the data set, the questions and answers, the code running and a walkthrough of the code.}

# Data Analysis Results

I originally came into this project with the question, "What would be a good board game for my family to play together?". However, as I created the program I realized it would be a better Idea to make it adaptable to any audience so I could use the same program for different groupd of people. Thus, the answer to the question changes based on the user and their preferences.

# Development Environment

I developed this program using Visual Studio Code in the Python language and using the pandas library.

# Future Work

* I would like to add the functionality for processing game mechanics and gameplay style/type
* It would also be neat to allow the user to select one of the suggested games and view more information about it, such as user comments, or game mechanics and style
